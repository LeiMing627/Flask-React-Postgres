## Bundled Extensions

The code ships with a set of recommended Visual Studio Code extensions that will empower the developement process of your Flask + React web application. These extensions include rich language support (code completion, go to definition) for both Python and JavaScript, as well as quick deploy to Azure from within VS Code. When the project is imported into VS Code, a notifcation will appear giving you the option to install these extensions.
